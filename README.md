# Princess & Roses Project

This is a project used to polish skills in React and UI Design. 

Princess & Roses is a game from combinatorical game theory in which two players are trying to win the hand of a princess by taking turns picking roses from different bushes (the roses on each bush are a different color). On a player's turn, they may either take one rose of any color or two roses of differing colors. The winner is the player who picks the final rose, leaving their opponent with no legal move.
